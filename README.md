## 🎯 About

I'm a cybersecurity student building a solid foundation toward a career as a
**SOC Analyst / Blue Team practitioner**. My approach combines academic
projects, hands-on labs, and industry certifications to develop practical
skills in detection, incident response, and threat intelligence — rather
than stopping at theory.

This repository is a working portfolio: each project reflects a specific
skill I wanted to build, from designing a SOC automation pipeline to
understanding attacker techniques well enough to detect them. I'm currently
looking for a **SOC / Security Analyst / Threat Intelligence internship**
where I can apply and grow these skills in a real operational environment.

## 🧭 Key Areas of Interest

`SOC Operations` · `Incident Response` · `Threat Intelligence` · `Digital Forensics (DFIR)` · `Network Security` · `Detection Engineering` · `Security Automation (SOAR)`

## 🗂️ Projects

Each project follows the same structure: **Objective → Features → Technologies.**

### Academic Projects

#### 1. [SIEM/SOAR Platform — SOC Automation with n8n](https://github.com/[github-username]/siem-soar-n8n)

*Academic project — ENSAM Casablanca*

![Architecture Diagram](docs /siem-soar-dashboard.png)
*dashboard screenshot / workflow diagram*

**Objective:** Simulate a functioning SOC pipeline — from log ingestion to
automated incident response — using a low-code orchestration engine.

**Features:**
- Brute-force detection via a persisted state-based detection model (PostgreSQL)
- Incident deduplication and correlation before escalation
- Automated enrichment of indicators through external threat intel APIs
- Human-in-the-loop validation (OTP confirmation) before any remediation action
- Simulated containment actions (firewall block, host isolation)
- SLA monitoring with automatic escalation
- Metrics dashboard (MTTD / MTTR)

**Technologies:**
`n8n` · `PostgreSQL / Supabase` · `Twilio API` · `VirusTotal API` · `AbuseIPDB API` · `MITRE ATT&CK`

---

#### 2. [CyberTrace CTI — Threat Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/[github-username]/cybertrace-cti)

*Academic project — team of 4 students, supervised by [SUPERVISOR NAME], [DATE]*

![Architecture Diagram](./docscybertrace-architecture.png)
*Add: class diagram / UI screenshot*

**Objective:** Build a platform to manage and correlate threat intelligence
data (indicators, threat actors, APT groups) mapped to a recognized
adversary framework.

**Features:**
- IOC management (IP, hash, domain, email)
- Threat actor and APT group profiling
- Campaign simulation based on MITRE ATT&CK
- Layered architecture with dedicated service/repository/security modules
- Unit test coverage (JUnit)

**Technologies:**
`Java 17` · `Maven` · `JUnit` · `MITRE ATT&CK`

---

#### 3. [Secure Routing — Dijkstra / OSPF](https://github.com/[github-username]/mini-projet-routage-securise)

*Academic project — individual, supervised by [SUPERVISOR NAME], [DATE]*

![Topology Diagram](./docs/screenshots/routing-topology.png)
*Add: Packet Tracer topology screenshot*

**Objective:** Apply graph theory to network routing decisions by
prioritizing security over raw performance in a sensitive-data network.

**Features:**
- Custom cost metric: `Cost = Latency + 10 × Risk`
- Optimal path computation across an 8-router mesh network
- Resilience testing under single and multiple link failures
- Automatic OSPF failover analysis

**Technologies:**
`Cisco Packet Tracer` · `OSPF` · `Dijkstra's Algorithm`

---

### Personal Security Labs

#### 4. [Reverse Shell Lab — Metasploit / Meterpreter](https://github.com/[github-username]/reverse-shell-lab)

![Lab Screenshot](./docs/screenshots/reverse-shell-demo.png)
*Add: Meterpreter session screenshot*

**Objective:** Understand a full attack chain end-to-end, from payload
delivery to post-exploitation, to build better detection logic.

**Features:**
- Payload generation and delivery (isolated host-only network)
- Meterpreter session and post-exploitation (recon, screenshot, keylogging)
- Full mapping to the Cyber Kill Chain
- Blue Team detection analysis (EDR/network indicators, Sigma rule)
- Remediation recommendations

**Technologies:**
`Metasploit Framework` · `msfvenom` · `Parrot OS` · `Windows 10` · `Sigma`

> ⚠️ Conducted exclusively in an isolated, host-only lab environment for
> educational purposes. No real system was targeted.

---

#### 5. [SMBv1 Exploitation Lab](https://github.com/[github-username]/vuln-smb-v1-exploitation-lab)

![Lab Screenshot](./docs/screenshots/smb-demo.png)
*Add: Nmap scan / smbclient enumeration screenshot*

**Objective:** Demonstrate the real-world impact of a deprecated protocol
left enabled in a corporate environment, and map its detection.

**Features:**
- Network reconnaissance and service enumeration (Nmap)
- Exploitation of weak credentials on an SMBv1 share
- Data enumeration and exfiltration via smbclient
- SOC detection analysis (Windows Event IDs, IDS signatures)
- Hardening recommendations (SMBv1 disablement, MFA, least privilege)

**Technologies:**
`Nmap` · `smbclient` · `VirtualBox / VMware`

> ⚠️ Conducted exclusively in an isolated lab environment for educational
> purposes. No real system was targeted.
